Hello, this is my first Data Science research. Its about detecting patterns in financial markets, for this i used a lot of techniques; statistics, probability, combinatorial analysis, brute force, markovian property, stochastic process principles, bayes theorem, EDA, among others... this focus on S&P500(Futures) but in general the logics and algorithms studied apply in any market, even FOREX.
